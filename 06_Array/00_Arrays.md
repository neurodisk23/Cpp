# Arrays

Arrays are included in the C++ programming language, just as they are in other languages. This means many of you are already familiar with arrays. So this is a good lesson to learn to use arrays.

Before you begin this lesson I should tell you one thing:

**In C++ you don't need to learn arrays.**

There is a good case that instead of using arrays, you can use vectors. Vectors are more powerful /versatile than arrays.

In this course I teach arrays because everyone knows them from another language and they are easier to learn. If you continue in the course we will learn about vectors and you will then have the tools to make your own Vector/Array decisions.

**C++ arrays can be declared as:
```
variableType arrayName [ ] = {variables to be stored in the array};
```
or as:
```
variableType arrayName[array size]
```
Information about arrays can be found at:
[C++ Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_arrays.htm)

We can access the values in an array by identifying the specific index.
```
variableType arrayName[ index number ]
```
